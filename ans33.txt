National Yang Ming University (hereinafter referred to as Yang Ming) and National Chiao Tung University (hereinafter referred to as Chiao Tung) will formally merge into the "National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University" (NYCU) on February 1, 2021. Yang Ming, which focuses on biomedical research, and Chiao Tung, which focuses on electronic communication research, are both top tier universities in Taiwan. Under the principle of "reciprocity and mutual trust", they have adopted a step-by-step integration model to complement their expertise to bring forth a novel disciplinary domain of teaching and pioneer the future of research and innovation. Thus, it is imagined that the merger will eventually bring forth a great and innovative university that is second to none, with 1,400 teachers and 17,000 students collaborating to create a great generation that will develop and further Taiwan's emerging smart medical industry. In addition to implementing effective integration and innovation under the conventional organizational structure of regular teaching, research, administration, and student affairs, NYCU is singularly unique as it will establish Taiwan's most innovative smart medical research. NYCU will combine the strengths of Yang Ming and Chiao Tung to jointly develop medical applications in terms of AI, telemedicine, medical robots, Internet of Things, wearable devices, and blockchain biomedical as Eco-system amongst other developments. NYCU's teaching mission will promote the development of a common language for disseminating cutting edge information via in-depth communication between medical experts and offer doctor-engineer course oriented towards resolving the needs of individuals and society. The newly-merged educational institute will also consider privacy protection, assist with revising the relevant medical-related laws and regulations, and study the impact of tangential yet still important issues affecting society, including ethics, economics, and the labor market. Furthermore, NYCU will formulate smart medical protocols via the establishment of standardization, accuracy, acquisition, storage, and processing of medical big data, while integrating various management platforms to concurrently build up the compatibility of medical IT systems.
